When I first met MDX, I thought: “You’re a markdown file... but... you execute *React*?” It was love at first render.

### ✨ Use case: Dynamic content in static posts

Example: I wanted to show live data from an AI model inference (like sarcasm detection 🤓). I just embedded a component.

```mdx
---
title: "How Sarcastic is This Blog Post?"
---

# Real-Time Sarcasm Score

<SarcasmMeter text="Wow, what a helpful error message 🙃" />

> Yep. That’s real-time React in a markdown file. Static file, dynamic heart.

### 🧩 Component Islands FTW

Combine that with `extends`, and your content structure stays clean. Imagine a static recipe blog where the ingredients list updates based on local grocery store prices. *(I know. Mind blown.)*

## 🔍 Summary:
- Static = fast, SEO-friendly
- Dynamic = reactive, interactive
- MDX = *both*, elegantly

Write once. Extend endlessly. Inject React like it's balsamic vinegar. 🍷
